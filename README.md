# frenchVocabFrequencyListLemmatized
A lemmatized French vocabulary list sourced from https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/French_wordlist_opensubtitles_5000. 

I use `spacy` to lemmatize and then `Spellchecker` to fix spelling mistakes that `spacy` creates.

Alternatively, you may want to lemmatize algorithmically by pulling redirects from wiktionary.
